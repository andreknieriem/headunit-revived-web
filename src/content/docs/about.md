## The Story Behind Headunit Revived

**Born from Frustration, Driven by Passion.**

Like many car enthusiasts, I wanted the seamless experience of Android Auto in my vehicle. I had a dedicated Android-based headunit, but I quickly realized that the existing solutions on the market were often unreliable, outdated, or simply didn't work with modern devices.

I wasn't ready to settle for a glitchy experience. That’s why I took the foundation of the original, pioneering "Headunit" project and breathed new life into it. What started as a personal quest to fix my own car's infotainment system evolved into **Headunit Revived**.

### Bringing it back to life
I’ve spent countless hours rewriting the video engine, optimizing performance for legacy hardware, and adding modern features like Wireless Auto-Discovery and Portrait Mode. My goal was simple: to create the most stable, high-performance, and user-friendly way to run Android Auto on any Android device.

### The Road Ahead
After months of intense development and invaluable feedback from our beta testing community, Headunit Revived is finally making its way to the **Google Play Store**. This isn't just a hobby project anymore—it's a mission to ensure that every driver can enjoy a modern, safe, and connected dashboard, no matter what hardware they use.
