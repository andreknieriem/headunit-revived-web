---

## General

### Do I need to root my Android Head Unit?
**No.** HeadUnit Revived works on standard Android installations without root access.

### Which Android versions are supported?
The app requires a Head Unit running **Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)** or higher. For best performance, especially with wireless projection, **Android 9.0+** is recommended.

### Does this work with Apple CarPlay?
**No.** This application effectively emulates an Android Auto receiver unit. It only supports Android phones via the Android Auto protocol.

## Setup & Configuration

### How do I hide the status bar?
Enable **Start in Fullscreen Mode** in the **Graphic Settings**.

### Can I change the car logo shown on Android Auto?
Currently, the app identifies itself as a generic Head Unit. Customization options for manufacturer/model may be added in future updates.

### How do I change the day/night map mode?
You can manually toggle **Night Mode** in the Settings, or set it to **Auto** to use the head unit's light sensor (if available) or time of day.

## Advanced

### Can I automate the connection?
**Yes.** If you enable **Wireless Headunit Server** (formerly Wireless Launcher Mode), the app will listen for connections in the background. You can also use automation tools like **Tasker** to launch the app or trigger a connection intent (`headunit://connect?ip=...`) when your car starts or Bluetooth connects.

### Where can I report bugs?
Please report issues on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/andreknieriem/headunit-revived/issues). Include your Head Unit model, Android version, and logs if possible.
