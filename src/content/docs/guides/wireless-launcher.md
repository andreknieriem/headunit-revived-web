description: Use helper apps to automate your wireless connection.

Helper apps are the most reliable way to establish a wireless connection between your phone and Headunit Revived. They automate the handshake process so you don't have to touch your phone when you get into the car.

## Recommended: Wireless Helper (New)

We developed [Wireless Helper](https://github.com/andreknieriem/wireless-helper) specifically for Headunit Revived. It is lightweight, modern, and supports both mDNS (Zero-Config) and Bluetooth auto-start.

### Setup
1. **Head Unit:** Go to Settings -> Wireless Mode and select **Helper Mode**.
2. **Phone:** Install [Wireless Helper](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.andrerinas.wirelesshelper).
3. **Configure:** In Wireless Helper, grant permissions and optionally select your car's Bluetooth for auto-start.
4. **Result:** Just start your car, and Android Auto will appear on your tablet automatically.

## Alternative: Original Wireless Launcher

Headunit Revived remains compatible with the original [Wireless Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.borconi.emil.wifilauncherforhur) app.

### Setup
1. **Head Unit:** Set Wireless Mode to **Helper Mode**.
2. **Network:** Ensure both devices are in the same WiFi network.
3. **Start:** Open the Launcher on your phone and start the service.

:::note
Wireless Helper is highly recommended for better stability and modern Android support.
